## IIT Mandi Git Hero 2021
Welcome you all to Git Hero 2021

## Plot
The [DehlaPakad](https://dehlapakad.com) team wants to create a new game. But the problem is Priyam and Pranshu are not ready to give the code of the game directly. They are smart, and they knew the team does not have a good idea about git and github. So they created a series of challenges and the team has to solve them in order to get the full fledged game. Now the team has came to IIT Mandi's freshers for their rescue. Help the team to gain the fully fledged working code of the Game.

## Get started
To get started, go to the [issues](https://github.com/KamandPrompt/git_hero_2021/issues) tab. Start with the challenge 1 to challenge 6. The scores for them are alongside and they go in order, so until you complete the challenge1, you cannot move to challenge2. You need to complete previous challenges first.

## Submission
You need to document all the steps you follow along the way in a file named `report.md`
Once you are done with the as many challenges as you were able to solve, you need to make a final Pull Request containing that file. 
The marks you get for each question will depend on the quality of your commits, time taken to make the commits, and how well you are able to explain the steps taken.

## Some Tips
Google, git status and git log are your best friends in this challenge.

Try to complete as many challenge as you can. All the Best! What are you waiting for now? Go start with the challenges.
